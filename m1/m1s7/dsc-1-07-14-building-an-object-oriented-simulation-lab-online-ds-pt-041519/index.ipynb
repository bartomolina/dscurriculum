    "* All individuals interact with the same amount of people each day\n",

    "    * That this statistic is accurate\n",
    "    \n",
    "Building simulations is always a trade-off, since the real world is very, very complex.  As we build our simulation, try to think about ways in which we could make our model more realistic by writing it in such a way that it eliminates one of the assumptions above (e.g. generating a float value for vaccine efficacy on a person-by-person level to eliminate our first assumption). \n",
