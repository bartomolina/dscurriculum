# M3: Probability, Sampling and AB Testing

## M3S17: Combinatorics and Probability
- Sets
- Probability: Probability axioms
- Permutations (subset, with replacement, with repetition)
- Combinations
- Conditional probability
  - Theorems (Product rule, chain rule, Bayes theorem)
  - Partitioning and law of total probability


## M3S18: Statistical Distributions
- Discrete vs. Continuous
- Probability mass function (PMF / **discrete**)
- Probability density function (PDF / **continuous**)
- Cumulative distribution function (CDF)
- Normal distribution
  - Standard normal distribution (0, 1) - z-score
- Statistical testing with z-score and p-value, significance threshold $\alpha$
- Skewness and Kurtosis
- Uniform distribution
- Poisson distribution
- Exponential distribution


## M3S19: Central Limit Theorem and Confidence Intervals
- Sampling
- Central limit theorem
- Standard error
- Confidence intervals. **Sample distribution** vs. a **sampling distribution**
  - T distribution


## M3S20: Hypothesis Testing
- Experimental design
- P-values and null hypothesis
    - Is the P-value less than alpha value?
- Effect size
  - Un-standardized or Simple Effect Size Calculation
- Conducting T-Tests
  - One sample t-test (whether a sample of observations could have been generated by a process with a specific mean)
  - Two sample t-test (determine if two population means are equal)
- Type I and Type II errors


## M3S21: Statistical Power and Anova
- Statistical power
- Welch's T-test
- ANOVA


## M3S22: AB Testing
